## DATA
The output tidy_data.txt is based on an experiment where activity data was collected from 30 participants using the accelerometer and gyroscope in the subjects' Samsung Galaxy X Smartphones. The first row is the column names and the subsequent rows are the averages of each variable by subject and activity type. Additional information on the study can be found here:   http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones as well as the README.txt file once the data is unzipped

## Dataset files
* features_info.txt: Shows information about the variables used
* features.txt: List of all features (variables)
* activity_labels.txt: Links the activity name to class label
* train/X_train.txt: Training set with subject data
* train/y_train.txt: Training labels used to link with activity name 
* test/X_test.txt: Test set with subject data
* test/y_test.txt: Test labels used to link with activity name

## Variables
* Subject: Anonymized subjects in the study, 1-30

* ActivityType: Type of activities performed by the subjects, 6 in total
  1. WALKING: subject walking during test
  2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS: subject walking upstairs during test
  3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS: subject walking downstairs during test
  4. SITTTING: subject standing during test
  6. LAYING: subject laying during test

## Measurements
* Signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for 3 different pattens denoted by  
  XYZ (signal directions):
    * tBodyAcc-XYZ
    * tGravityAcc-XYZ
    * tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
    * tBodyGyro-XYZ
    * tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
    * tBodyAccMag
    * tGravityAccMag
    * tBodyAccJerkMag
    * tBodyGyroMag
    * tBodyGyroJerkMag
    * fBodyAcc-XYZ
    * fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
    * fBodyGyro-XYZ
    * fBodyAccMag
    * fBodyAccJerkMag
    * fBodyGyroMag
    * fBodyGyroJerkMag

- Variables were estimated based on the signals and they included: 
    * mean(): Mean value
    * std(): Standard deviation
    * mad(): Median absolute deviation 
    * max(): Largest value in array
    * min(): Smallest value in array
    * sma(): Signal magnitude area
    * energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
    * iqr(): Interquartile range 
    * entropy(): Signal entropy
    * arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
    * correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
    * maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
    * meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
    * skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
    * kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
    * bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
    * angle(): Angle between to vectors

* Additional vectors: 
    * gravityMean
    * tBodyAccMean
    * tBodyAccJerkMean
    * tBodyGyroMean
    * tBodyGyroJerkMean
