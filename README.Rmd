## Repository:

* README.Rmd: dataset overview and steps taken to transform it
* CODEBOOK.Rmd: content of the data set and how it was transformed
* run_analysis.R: script that generates the tidy data
* tidy_data.csv: tidy data that averages each variable by subject and activity type

## User Information
After checking out run_analysis.R modify line 10 to your working directory and then run the script. It will download the experiment information from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones, transform it using the steps in CODEBOOK.Rmd, and generate a tidy_data.csv file in the working directory

## Project Summary
Project instructions: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
